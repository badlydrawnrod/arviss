# Very Angry Robots III

**31/8/21**

I've started work on a new Arviss example, *Very Angry Robots III*. This is a rewrite of a game that I've made a few times over the years, most recently about 10 years ago using the rather excellent [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-demo-very-angry-robots). The game itself is a typical 2d arena shooter, based heavily on [Berzerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berzerk_(video_game)).

Howver, in this implementation the enemy robots will each be controlled by their own Arviss VM.

The example will use [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), just like the *Turtles* example does, because Raylib is a "simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming." I like it because it is genuinely easy to use, well-documented, cross-platform, and it has highly readable C99 source code. It doesn't hurt that it also plays well with CMake.
